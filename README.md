# Plagiarism-Checker
A simple application written in c language to check for plagiarism of a current document with other documents in the database. I have removed the file system for now as i will be implementing other database soon.

## Changes ##
The Plagchecker2.c tries to find the Plagiarism Percentage using a different algorithm. In this algorithm, we try to remove the stop words in documents and creates a vocabulary list for each documment and compares them to find the plagiarism percentage
